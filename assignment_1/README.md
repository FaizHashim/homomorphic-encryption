# Assignment 1

In this assignment, a model of the system is created, in which the Query User (QU), the Data Owner (DO)
and the Cloud Server (CS) are present. The communication between them is simulated with the help
of socket programming. This assignment is a basic introduction to socket programming in Python.

In order to simulate the system, simply run each of the files in separate terminals.

The command to run the Cloud server is:
```
python ./cloud_server/cs.py
```

The command to run the Data Owner server is:
```
python ./data_owner/do.py
```

The command to simulate the Query User is:
```
python ./query_user/qu.py
```
